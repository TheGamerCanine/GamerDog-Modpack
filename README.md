Universal installer for all of my Minecraft modpacks! My intention was to make the installer open for people to make their own modpacks with it, and I plan to upload a guide for that soon. The program remains in a very small formfactor by pulling mod files directly from curseforge and github to the user instead of hosting the mod files locally so that the program can be installed quickly and the process of downloading the modpacks is easier for the end user.
