This modpack is intended for version 1.12.2 of Minecraft, and includes a number of mods that are intended specifically to add more content to the game without overwhelming the user as I feel many modpacks have a tendency of doing. The mods included are listed [here](https://github.com/TheGamerCanine/GamerDog-Modpack/blob/main/credit.txt).
